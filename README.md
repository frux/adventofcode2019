My solutions of https://adventofcode.com/2019/

## Disclaimer
All solutions are written in Typescript. Why? Because I like it. I didn't seek to write the shortest/fastest code. The only thing I aimed was to write code I'd like.

## Run solution
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start <day-number> <task-number>`

For example, to see how I solved the second task of the first day run `npm run start 1 2`.
